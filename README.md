//make a triangle and square
//EBO (optional)
//can read file (optional)
//implement matrix and vector
//convert 3D model data to 4 units vector
//normalize
//matrices multiplication 4X4 * 4X4 and 4X4 * 4X1
//translate, rotate
//rotate and strech a square
//convert transformed matrices to screen view, perspective projection matrix
